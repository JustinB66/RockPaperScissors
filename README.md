# RockPaperScissors
A Rock, Paper, Scissors game with HTML, CSS, and JS
I've been trying to improve my JS skills, so this looked like a fun project I could clone to do so.  
Thought about doing something funny, like a picture of The Rock for the "rock" part of Rock, Paper, Scissors, but couldn't make it work...
